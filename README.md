# Berkel-pee
Introducing a mobile app that allows users to upvote the gender-inclusive bathrooms on the UC Berkeley campus. <br />
Created with React Native code, the cloud-hosted database feature of Firebase, and Expo. <br />
All data for bathrooms is stored in a FlatList data structure. Built @ Cal Hacks 2017. <br />

Now you can always find a good place to Berkel-pee in Berkeley!
